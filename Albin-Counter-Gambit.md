## Teoria w skrócie
  
Black gives up his pawn on e5 so that his d pawn can be nicely placed on d4. This pawn is a huge thorn in the side of white and there are many trap that come from the Albin Counter-Gambit that white has to be on the lookout for. One of the most common traps in the Albin Counter-Gambit is the Lasker Trap which punishes white if he tries to attack the pawn on d4 with e3.  
This opening will immediately take a queens gambit player out of his element and gives black many fighting chances. If you are a very aggressive player, especially with black, then you definitely need to learn this opening. For all those queen’s gambit players, this is also good to know as your opponent may throw this at you at any time.
