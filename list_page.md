**Adelaide Counter Gambit**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1.e4 e5
2.f4 Nc6
3.Nf3 f5  
When white plays the King’s Gambit they are usually looking to give up material and then have the initiative for the early part of the game. This defense turns the tables on white and gives black multiple attacking lines and control of the center. White has to be careful because if they don’t play properly there are many traps they can fall into. Below are different options they have after 3…f5.... [Więcej]

**Albin Counter-Gambit**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. d4 d5
2. c4 e5  
Black gives up his pawn on e5 so that his d pawn can be nicely placed on d4. This pawn is a huge thorn in the side of white and there are many trap that come from the Albin Counter-Gambit that white has to be on the lookout for. One of the most common traps in the Albin Counter-Gambit is the Lasker Trap which punishes white if he tries to attack the pawn on d4 with e3.... [Więcej]

**Alekhine Defense**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. e4 Nf6  
Black looks to allow white to chase his knight all over the board with tempo gaining pawn moves that will control the center of the board. In exchange for the center control, black will look to undermine the overextended pawns from white.... [Więcej]

**Belgrade Gambit**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Nc3 Nf6
4. d4 exd4
5. Nd5  
White’s most common move after 4…exd4 is to recapture with 5. Nxd4 but Nd5 allows white to transition into the Belgrade Gambit. As with many less known gambits, the Belgrade gets much of its advantage from your opponent not being familiar with how to play correctly as black. The good thing about this variation is that if you play 1. e4 2. Nf3 you’ll get many opportunities to try this out as it’s fairly easy to transition into a four knights game.... [Więcej]

**Benoni Defense**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 c5
3. d5  
In the Modern Benoni Defense, the main focus of the game is white’s center control of the light squares with its key pawn on d5 and black’s control of the center from the dark squares. Black will usually fianchetto his bishop on the kingside to g7 to add extra support to the dark squares.... [Więcej]

**Bird’s Opening**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. f4  
After black defends with d5 the game will transpose into a reverse of the Dutch defense, where white opens with d4 and black responds with f5. White’s main focus is on the dark squares in the game which is a big difference than the usual light squares that white usually focuses on.... [Więcej]  
***  
**Bishop’s Opening**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. e4 e5
2. Bc4  
White decides to develop the light square bishop before bringing the knight to f3. The three main responses from black are 2…Nf6, 2…Nc6, and 2…Bc5. White has good chances against each of these lines and can fall into more popular opening variations if they choose. ... [Więcej]

**Blackmar-Diemer Gambit**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. d4 d5
2. e4 dxe4
3. Nc3  
From the second move white looks to give away his king’s pawn. Although many top GM’s find this to be unsound, many club level players have great success with it and if you are a very aggressive player I recommend playing it from time to time.... [Więcej]  
***  
**Bogo Indian Defense**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e6
3. Nf3 Bb4+  
Many players with the white pieces will choose the third move Nf3 instead of Nc3 because they want to avoid the Nimzo Indian Defense. Black has multiple options after Nf3 but Bb4+ is a common move seen at all levels of play.... [Więcej]  
***  
**Budapest Gambit**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e5  
In the second move, black looks to give up his pawn on e5 but then starts to develop of his pieces to add pressure on the e5 pawn. White will be unable to hold onto the extra pawn and therefore many times will just give back the pawn and continue to develop pieces and not worry about the pawn advantage.... [Więcej]  
***  
**Calabrese Countergambit**  
Rozpoczynająco go ruchy:  
1. e4 e5
2. Bc4 f5  
Black usually ends up with a very strong center while white’s pieces struggle to find great squares to develop. White must play very precise or he can easily find himself in a lot of trouble.... [Więcej]
